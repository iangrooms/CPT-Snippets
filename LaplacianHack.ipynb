    "The version on the right is in flux form. We want to make sure that $\\int\\nabla^2u=0$ (because it implies $\\int u = \\int\\bar{u}$). This can be ensured by discretizing in flux form. Doing that has two steps: find $\\partial_xu$ on the left and right cell boundaries, then compute $\\partial_x(\\partial_xu)$ by just subtracting the flux at the left from the flux at the right and then dividing by the cell size. (Same thing for the $y$ derivatives.)\n",

    "Suppose we're dealing with cell $i$, which has width $h_i$. (This would be found in MOM6's dxCu variable if you're doing an $x$ derivative of $u$; see also dyCu, dxCv, and dyCv.) The cell to the left has width $h_{i-1}$, etc.\n",
    "The simplest finite-volume approximation of $\\partial_x u$ at the left cell boundary is\n",

    "\n",
    "(Note that MOM6 also has a variable called $h$. It's not the same thing as my notation above. MOM6's $h$ is a vertical cell size; I'm using the notation $h$ for a horizontal spacing.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Also the spacing in the $x$ direction only depends on the $y$ location, which simplifies things too. We don't really need to use the non-equispaced formula anywhere, we just need to make sure that we use the correct $h$ when computing $x$ derivatives."
